## Football Match Outcome Prediction using Machine Learning

This notebook demonstrates a machine learning approach to predict the outcomes of football matches between national teams using historical match results and team rankings.

### Contents:
- **Step 1: Load and Preprocess Data**: Loading match results, rankings, and preprocessing steps.
- **Step 2: Feature Engineering**: Creating relevant features such as rank differences, location-based features, and more.
- **Step 3: Model Training**: Building and training a Random Forest Classifier to predict match outcomes.
- **Step 4: Prediction and Evaluation**: Evaluating the model's performance and predicting outcomes for new matches.

## Model Architecture

The model used in this notebook is a Random Forest Classifier implemented using scikit-learn. Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.

### Key Features:
- **Input Features**: Rank difference, rank ratio, total rank, home advantage, and neutral location.
- **Output**: Predicted outcome (Win/Loss) of the home team based on historical match data and team rankings.
## Installation

To run this notebook, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

- **pandas**
- **numpy**
- **scikit-learn**
- **matplotlib**
- **seaborn**


You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

This notebook assumes Python 3.x and a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Training the Model

To train the model:

1. Ensure you have downloaded the dataset and placed it in the correct folder.
2. Run each cell sequentially in the notebook to load the data, preprocess it, and train the model.
3. Monitor the training process and evaluate the model's performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Running Inference on `predict.txt`

To predict outcomes for new matches listed in `predict.txt`:

1. Ensure `predict.txt` contains the list of matches in the correct format.
2. Execute the notebook cells that load the prediction data, preprocess it, and use the trained model to predict outcomes.
3. View or save the predicted outcomes as required.
